# library

This is a simple library that will include following features:

- Add new books to the library
- Remove books from the library
- Add/Change read status
- Book will have title, author and no. of pages

What I have learned by completing this project:

- I have implemented oop concept
- I can add a card to webpage using js
- I can remove the card from the webpage using js
- I can validate input fields showing error if the input is incorrect
- I know how to create a pop up modal
- I can add dark mode

Overall this project seemed a bit difficult at start, then when I really focused and tried couple of times I overcame the obstacles that I faced through out the project.
